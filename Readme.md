# Stacklands BugFixes Mod

Fixes various bugs in the game:
- HealLowest special attacks no longer damage the healed units
- When dragging a stack onto a fight, add all cards to it
- Only spawn island ideas pack after the first Demon kill
- Fix resolution setting sometimes not loading correctly

## Manual Installation
This mod requires BepInEx to work. BepInEx is a modding framework which allows multiple mods to be loaded.

1. Download and install BepInEx from the [Thunderstore](https://stacklands.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_Stacklands/).
4. Download this mod and extract it into `BepInEx/plugins/`
5. Launch the game

## Development
1. Install BepInEx
2. This mod uses publicized game DLLs to get private members without reflection
   - Use https://github.com/CabbageCrow/AssemblyPublicizer for example to publicize `Stacklands/Stacklands_Data/Managed/GameScripts.dll` (just drag the DLL onto the publicizer exe)
   - This outputs to `Stacklands_Data\Managed\publicized_assemblies\GameScripts_publicized.dll` (if you use another publicizer, place the result there)
3. Compile the project. This copies the resulting DLL into `<GAME_PATH>/BepInEx/plugins/`.
   - Your `GAME_PATH` should automatically be detected. If it isn't, you can manually set it in the `.csproj` file.
   - If you're using VSCode, the `.vscode/tasks.json` file should make it so that you can just do `Run Build`/`Ctrl+Shift+B` to build.
